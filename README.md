# The Self-Employment Tax Calculator

I'm a sole proprietor (writer and editor) and I generate a lot of self-employment income. Occasionally I need to quickly estimate my taxes based on a specific amount of income. So I created this calculator to do just that.

## How it works

It's nothing more than a simple VueJS single file app. Check out the code, and fall in love with Vue. <3
